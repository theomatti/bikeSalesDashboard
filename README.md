Bike sales dashboard in Excel - tracking sales data visually.

Welcome to the Bike Sales Dashboard project on Excel! This project was inspired by Alex the Analyst on YouTube, and is aimed at visualizing sales data in a more effective and user-friendly way.

To create the dashboard and graphs, I used Excel's built-in features such as pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting. In addition, I cleaned the data by removing any errors or inconsistencies, and filtered out any unnecessary data that was not relevant to the analysis.

The resulting dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of key metrics such as total sales, revenue, and average selling price, as well as more detailed breakdowns by product type and region. I hope this project serves as a helpful resource for anyone looking to analyze and visualize sales data using Excel.

To see the project in action, please check out the code and data files on my GitHub repository. Thank you for your interest in the Bike Sales Dashboard project!
